- Review the texts.
- Rewrite and improve the help.
- Save and restore game sessions.
- Replace location ranges, eg. `=saxon_village_loc to
  fallen_away_loc`, with explicit lists.
- Replace location comparions, eg. `<` and `>`, with functions.
- Rename `saxons_follow`? It's a counter. `saxons_countdown`? Maybe
  use a real time counter instead.
- Init the exits with a procedure, not reading from data lines.
- Check the discovery of the cave entrance. The entrance is not hidden
  anymore. It seems a recent bug.
- Use an `enum` function to init the identifiers. Then make sure their
  data can be in any order, adding the identifier itself as the first
  datum.
- Factor all possible meanings currently defined for `do_break`.
- Add `nothing` identifier. Add to `sel`. Use in current `=false`.
- Replace 1st person error messages (eg. "No conozco ese verbo") with
  generic ones, ie. kill the narrator.
- Fix: "stone" is used in the description of the flint, but it's not a
  synonym.
- Improve the general syntax checker.
- Abandon compatibility with SuperBASIC using SBASIC-only features?
- Add "exits/x" action.
- Improve error "No conozco ese verbo".
