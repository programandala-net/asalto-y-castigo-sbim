- Review the texts.
- Rewrite and improve the help.
- Save and restore game sessions.
- Replace location ranges, eg. `=saxon_village_loc to
  fallen_away_loc`, with explicit lists.
- Replace location comparions, eg. `<` and `>`, with functions.
- Rename `saxons_follow`? It's a counter. `saxons_countdown`? Maybe
  use a real time counter instead.
- Init the exits with a procedure, not reading from data lines.
- Check the discovery of the cave entrance. The entrance is not hidden
  anymore. It seems a recent bug.
- Use an `enum` function to init the identifiers. Then make sure their
  data can be in any order, adding the identifier itself as the first
  datum.
