- Review the texts.
- Rewrite and improve the help.
- Save and restore game sessions.
- Replace location ranges, eg. `=saxon_village_loc to
  fallen_away_loc`, with explicit lists.
- Replace location comparions, eg. `<` and `>`, with functions.
- Init the exits with a procedure, not reading from data lines.
- Check the discovery of the cave entrance. The entrance is not hidden
  anymore. It seems a recent bug.
- Factor all possible meanings currently defined for `do_break`.
- Fix: "stone" is used in the description of the flint, but it's not a
  synonym.
- Improve the general syntax checker.
- Add "exits/x" action.
- Split `location_plot` into actual plot, which must be executed only
  the first time a location is entered, and specific descriptions,
  which are shown every time the location is described.
- Add `nothing` and set `ulfius` to 1.
- Rename `hacked_the_log` to `sharpen_the_log`?
- Implement command line history.
- Replace attribute identifiers with a bitmask.
- Remove unnecessary splits. Convert short `if` to long.
- Improve `do_swim`: implement the other direction.
- Improve `do_swim`: add a cuirass.
- Combine `nowhere` and `limbo`.
- Use 0-index arrays. Therefore, do not use zero as special
  identifiers.
- Fix: "rocks" are mentioned in the description of the fallen away,
  but `the_rocks` entity exists in other location. The easiest
  solution is creating two entities with identical name and a layer to
  choose the right one depending on the current location or other
  conditions.
- Add locations to the ordinary entities.
- Finish abandoning compatibility with SuperBASIC.
- Improve: Compare `ex x` when `x` is not recognized and when `x` is
  not present.
