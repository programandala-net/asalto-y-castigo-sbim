- Review the texts.
- Rewrite and improve the help.
- Save and restore game sessions.
- Replace location ranges, eg. `=saxon_village_loc to
  fallen_away_loc`, with explicit lists.
- Replace location comparions, eg. `<` and `>`, with functions.
- Rename `saxons_follow`? It's a counter. `saxons_countdown`? Maybe
  use a real time counter instead.
- Init the exits with a procedure, not reading from data lines.
- Check the discovery of the cave entrance. The entrance is not hidden
  anymore. It seems a recent bug.
- Make sure the entities `data` lines can be in any order, adding the
  identifier itself as the first datum.
- Factor all possible meanings currently defined for `do_break`.
- Replace 1st person error messages (eg. "No conozco ese verbo") with
  generic ones, ie. kill the narrator.
- Fix: "stone" is used in the description of the flint, but it's not a
  synonym.
- Improve the general syntax checker.
- Abandon compatibility with SuperBASIC using SBASIC-only features?
- Add "exits/x" action.
- Improve error "No conozco ese verbo".
- Split `location_plot` into actual plot, which must be executed only
  the first time a location is entered, and specific descriptions,
  which are shown every time the location is described.
- Do not use `ulfius` identifier to take/drop. Write a wrapper.
- Add `nothing` and set `ulfius` to 1.
- Update notation "thing" to "entity".
- Rename `hacked_the_log` to `sharpen_the_log`?
- Implement command line history.
- Replace attribute identifiers with a bitmask.
